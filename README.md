## how to use

server side:
1. put the files on your webserver
2. you're done

client side:
1. install [this extension](https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html "this extension"), feed won't work without it.
2. go to the settings and set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" to *
3. turn the thing on
4. now feed should work, user posts doesn't need this

this is a bandaid fix btw.
